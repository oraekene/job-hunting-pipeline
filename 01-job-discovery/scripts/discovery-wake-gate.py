job-hunting discovery wake-gate — a Hermes cron `script=` pre-run gate.

Purpose (see 01-job-discovery/SKILL.md, "Cost control: the wake-gate
script", and cron/cron-jobs.md job #1): 01-job-discovery's discovery-scan
cron job currently pays for a full LLM agent turn on every tick — up to
6x/day, every day, forever — whether or not anything new actually exists
to look at. This script runs as that job's `script=` pre-run step and
does the cheap part first: check the sources this script knows how to
check cheaply, and tell Hermes's cron system to skip waking the agent
entirely (zero token cost) when nothing survived the cheap filter.

Contract (user-guide/features/cron.md, "Skipping the agent entirely:
wakeAgent"): print a single JSON object to stdout as the LAST line;
{"wakeAgent": false} skips the agent turn for this tick, anything else
(including no wakeAgent key, or this script erroring out) wakes it
normally.

FAILS OPEN, deliberately — the opposite direction from the submit-gate
hook in security/hooks/verify-submit-approval.py, and for a specific
reason: the cost of an unnecessary wake is one LLM turn; the cost of a
wrongly-skipped wake is a real posting sitting unseen until the next
tick, which is exactly the "speed matters" finding 01-job-discovery's
own SKILL.md already leads with. So: any source type this script can't
cheaply check, any error reading a source, any error in this script
itself — every one of those wakes the agent rather than skips it. This
script only ever recommends a skip when it positively confirmed nothing
changed across every source it was ABLE to check, and defers to the
agent for everything else.

Scope, honestly stated: this script cheap-checks `rss` and `email_label`
sources only (the two cheapest and most common source types in this
pipeline). `aggregator_api`, `open_web_search`, `google_dork`,
`linkedin_search_url`, `indeed_search_url`, `scrape_and_filter`, and
`export_file` sources always cause a wake — there's no cost saving for
those yet. If most of your sources.yaml entries are one of those types,
this gate will rarely fire and that's expected, not a bug.
