# Cold DM / Email / Reply Record — official schema

**Status: confirmed, and now extended.** Kenechukwu reviewed the original
shape and it stands as the official schema going forward — extend it
(new fields, new enum values) rather than replace it, which is what
everything below does. The content-generation formula that was the one
piece still coming separately now exists —
`cold-dm-content-formula.md` — and slots into the generation
step exactly as originally planned.

That resolved one gap; a completeness pass turned up others worth
naming explicitly rather than leaving implied:

1. **Content formula** — resolved, see above.
2. **Connection-prerequisite workflow** — `contact.relationship` was a
   static snapshot with no state machine behind it. Resolved by the new
   `connection` block below and `linkedin-connection-flow.md`.
3. **Send-path diversity within one platform** — LinkedIn alone now has
   three real send paths (connection-gated DM, InMail, Open Profile),
   not one. Resolved by `routing.send_method`'s expanded values and
   `inmail-credits.md`.
4. **Platform-gate tracking on X and IG/FB** — the matrix named these
   constraints without tracking state against them. Resolved by the new
   `x_follow_state` and `ig_fb_window` blocks below.
5. **Length calibration** — `platform_char_limit` existed as a field
   with nothing populating it from real numbers. Resolved by
   `cold-dm-content-formula.md`'s length table.

One schema for both DMs and emails, distinguished by `message.channel`,
because they share almost every field — a cold email is structurally a
cold DM with a subject line and looser length limits.

```yaml
# social_outreach record shape — illustrative only. Actually persisted
# as the social_outreach SQL table (shared/applications_db_schema_
# addendum.sql, extended in _addendum_2.sql) — there is no separate
# shared/social_outreach.schema.yaml file; this YAML block is here to
# show the shape readably, not to name a real file to create.
# Mirrors the applications table's discipline: every attempt logged
# (Rule 4), nothing sent without approval (Rule 1), no claim without
# evidence (Rule 2, via fidelity_check below).

## Design notes on the schema's own field choices

These predate the content formula and stay true now that it exists —
they're about why the *data shape* looks the way it does, not about
content rules, which is exactly why they read as reasonable now instead
of being superseded by `cold-dm-content-formula.md`:

- `personalization_hooks` is deliberately a list, not a free-text
  paragraph — `11-analytics-and-learning` can eventually correlate hook
  *type* against reply rate the same way it already correlates tactic
  flags on `applications` against outcomes, once there's enough volume
  logged. Worth keeping the vocabulary for hook types small and
  consistent from the start (a short enum, not open text) if that
  analysis is ever wanted. The content formula's hook section (see
  "Hook" in `cold-dm-content-formula.md`) is what actually populates
  this field now — the field's shape was speculative when written, the
  formula is what makes it real.
- `source_cta_context` intentionally stores what the *post* asked for,
  not a paraphrase of Hermes's interpretation of it — keeps the record
  honest about whether the outreach actually matched what was requested.
- This table lives alongside `applications` in the same SQLite file — see
  `shared/applications_db_schema_addendum.sql`, extended for everything
  in this pass by `shared/applications_db_schema_addendum_6.sql`.
