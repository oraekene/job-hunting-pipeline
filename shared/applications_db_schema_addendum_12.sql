-- Addendum 12 — journal-derived features
--
-- The journal has been a pipeline INPUT: it feeds the STAR bank, the
-- career-event cascade, calibration. Almost none of its value to Kenechukwu
-- directly was built. These tables back the features that change that.
--
-- Apply after applications_db_schema_addendum_11.sql.

-- Recurring collaborators, derived from journal entries. Warm network,
-- which 17-cold-prospecting currently has no access to while it reaches
-- for cold contacts.
