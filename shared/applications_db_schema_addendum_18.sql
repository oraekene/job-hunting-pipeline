-- Addendum 18 — portfolio artifacts, link health, and publish history
--
-- 23-portfolio-onepager's content selection lives in
-- shared/portfolio-manifest.yaml, which is right: it is configuration
-- Kenechukwu edits and reads. What does NOT belong in a YAML file is the
-- time-series — every link check, every publish, every variant's history
-- — because that grows without bound and nobody wants it in a file they
-- open to change an ordering.
--
-- THE POINT OF THE ARTIFACT TABLE. A portfolio without links is a CV
-- with worse ATS compatibility. Links are the reason the page exists, so
-- their health is load-bearing rather than housekeeping: a page with dead
-- links looks careless in exactly the dimension it was built to
-- demonstrate.
--
-- And the failure is silent. Nothing tells you a repo went private, a
-- Colab now needs permission, or a demo host shut down. Only a check
-- does.
--
-- Apply after applications_db_schema_addendum_17.sql. Fully idempotent.
