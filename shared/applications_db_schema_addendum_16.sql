-- Addendum 16 — fact aging and supersession
--
-- last_confirmed_at existed in exactly four places before this: written
-- by 07-context-architect at Phase 0 and Phase 0.5, declared null in two
-- templates. NOTHING READ IT. The package had a timestamp on its facts
-- and no behaviour attached to it.
--
-- Meanwhile the memory model is append-only by design (Rule 5: facts are
-- added on confirmation, nothing silently overwrites), which is correct
-- and has one cost — a superseded fact and a current fact sit side by
-- side looking identical. Kenechukwu's salary floor from eighteen months ago
-- and from last week are both true statements that were confirmed, and
-- only one is true now.
--
-- Every other piece of memory work in this package sharpened RETRIEVAL:
-- the holographic layer, qmd, the taxonomy vector index, STAR-bank
-- compression. None of it makes stale facts stop being returned. Better
-- retrieval over unaged memory returns the wrong answer faster.
--
-- See 07-context-architect/references/fact-conflict-resolution.md.
--
-- WHY AN OVERLAY. The facts are not in this database. fact_store is a
-- Hermes-native tool with its own storage and no schema we can extend,
-- and the rest of the pipeline's memory is YAML and markdown. There is
-- no facts table to ALTER. Per-entry stamps in the memory files carry
-- most of the load; this table carries the metadata for fact_store
-- entries, where we cannot attach it directly.
--
-- The compromise is real: this can drift from fact_store if a fact is
-- deleted through the tool. Hence the reconcile pass below. The
-- alternative — writing aging metadata into the fact text itself, where
-- fact_store would index it as content — pollutes semantic search and
-- makes every probe noisier. A drift-prone sidecar that keeps retrieval
-- clean is the better trade, and the drift is detectable.
--
-- Apply after applications_db_schema_addendum_15.sql. Fully idempotent
-- (no ALTER TABLE), unlike _14 and _15.

-- where the overlay's one weakness is dealt with:
--
--   1. For every non-superseded row with fact_ref LIKE 'fact_store:%',
--      probe fact_store for that id. No result => the fact was deleted
--      through the tool. Mark the overlay row superseded with
--      resolved_by='reverted' and a reason, rather than leaving a stamp
--      pointing at nothing.
--   2. Report any fact_store entry with no overlay row as unaged. Do not
--      auto-create one — a default timestamp would be a fabrication, and
--      an unaged fact honestly labelled is better than a fact carrying a
--      confirmation date nobody ever gave.
--   3. Never write to fact_store from this pass. It reads only.
