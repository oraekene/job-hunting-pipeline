-- Addendum 17 — fact influence, the second ranking dimension
--
-- Holographic gives every fact a trust score (0.0-1.0, default 0.5,
-- moved by fact_feedback). It is the only ranking dimension the provider
-- has, and it measures RELIABILITY — is this fact correct.
--
-- Nothing measured IMPORTANCE. "Kenechukwu's daughter is called Ada" can be
-- perfectly trustworthy and irrelevant to a job application; "Kenechukwu will
-- not relocate" is decisive. Both sat at 0.5, and wiring fact_feedback
-- on does not fix that — it makes trust scores move along the
-- reliability axis and only ever along that axis.
--
-- See 07-context-architect/references/fact-influence-scoring.md.
--
-- WHY EVENTS AND NOT A COUNTER. Influence is recomputed from events
-- every run rather than incremented in place. A running total drifts,
-- and it cannot implement the 180-day trailing window without a second
-- decay pass to undo itself. The events are the truth.
--
-- WHY NOT RETRIEVAL COUNTS. Those are trivially available and
-- completely misleading — the most-retrieved fact in any career memory
-- bank is something like a current job title, retrieved constantly and
-- deciding almost nothing. Only events where a fact CHANGED an output
-- are recorded here.
--
-- Apply after applications_db_schema_addendum_16.sql. Fully idempotent.
