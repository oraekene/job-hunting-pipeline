-- Job-hunting pipeline database schema

-- MIGRATION NOTE for a database that already exists: `CREATE TABLE IF NOT
-- EXISTS` does nothing for a table that's already there, so a column added
-- to an existing table's definition here won't retroactively appear on
-- disk. If you're re-running this file against a DB created before the
-- interview-prep upgrade pass, run this once first:
--   ALTER TABLE applications ADD COLUMN last_interview_prep_at TIMESTAMP;
-- New installs don't need this — the CREATE TABLE below already has it.

-- Open gaps flagged by 09-risk-tactics-gate — see that skill's own "Fail
-- handling" section for exactly when a row gets written here.
--
-- This table exists specifically so 09-risk-tactics-gate never writes to
-- ~/.hermes/memories/MEMORY.md. Two reasons, not one:
--   1. Rule 5 (shared/pipeline-rules.md) reserves memory writes for
--      07-context-architect alone, after Kenechukwu confirms a fact in the
--      interview loop. An unattended gate appending straight to MEMORY.md
--      during a cron run is exactly the write Rule 5 exists to prevent,
--      regardless of good intent.
--   2. MEMORY.md has a hard ~2,200-character cap and does NOT auto-compact
--      — a write past the cap returns an error and expects the SAME TURN
--      to consolidate before retrying. There is no one available to do
--      that during an unattended pipeline sweep (cron/cron-jobs.md job #3),
--      and an unbounded "Open gaps" list will eventually hit that cap.
-- A SQLite table has no such ceiling and is the pattern this whole schema
-- already uses everywhere else.
