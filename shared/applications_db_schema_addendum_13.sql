-- Addendum 13 — hired: pause, then resume at a higher tier
--
-- Two gaps, and the second is the interesting one.
--
-- GAP 1: nothing pauses. Kenechukwu accepts an offer and jobs 1, 2, 3, 10 and
-- 13 keep running. He gets a discovery digest on his first Monday at the
-- new job, and in-flight applications sit staged for roles he no longer
-- wants.
--
-- GAP 2: the calibration system is ASYMMETRIC and only bends one way.
-- auto_relax_schedule widens the net downward the longer a search runs
-- while unemployed. There is no inverse. Nothing narrows the net UPWARD
-- when Kenechukwu levels up: after two years as a Lead the pipeline will still
-- happily surface Analyst roles, because match_score does not know that
-- a role he could do easily is now a step backwards.
--
-- A tool for rising through a career needs the second half of that
-- schedule, not just a pause button.
--
-- Apply after applications_db_schema_addendum_12.sql.
