-- Addendum 14 — the stepping-stone engine
--
-- Addendum 4 gave career_path_plan_stepping_stones four working columns:
-- sequence_order, title, job_zone, status. That was enough to RECORD a
-- hop somebody had already decided on. It was not enough to generate
-- one, justify one, check one is reachable, or track what happens when
-- reality diverges from it — and Step 3's rule for producing hops was a
-- single bullet keyed off a job_zone delta.
--
-- See 19-career-path-planner/references/stepping-stone-engine.md for the
-- full method. What the schema has to hold, that it did not:
--
--   1. Candidate PATHS, not just the chosen one. One-three-one (S11)
--      means presenting three routes, and "why did I rule out the
--      direct path" is a question the record should still answer in a
--      year. Rejected candidates were previously discarded at
--      presentation time.
--   2. The two-sided scores. A hop is only a hop if it is reachable
--      from here AND closes gaps toward the target. Neither term
--      existed as a column.
--   3. The gaps a hop is FOR. Without these, 'achieved' can only mean
--      "he took the job", never "the job did what it was chosen to do."
--   4. Per-hop roadmap items. The roadmap was target-scoped, so on a
--      two-hop plan every item belonged to a role two moves away.
--   5. Statuses for skipped / substituted / matured. Real careers
--      produce all three constantly and the old enum could express
--      none of them.
--
-- Apply after applications_db_schema_addendum_13.sql.

-- 1. Candidate paths. The direct path is ALWAYS one of these rows, even
-- when a hop is recommended — the comparison is the point, and a
-- recommendation with nothing to compare against is not a choice.
