-- Addendum 11 — postings that disappear mid-pipeline (D10)
--
-- Postings get pulled: the role is filled, the req is frozen, the board
-- listing expires. The ghost-check job handles no RESPONSE; nothing
-- handled the posting itself vanishing between discovery and submission.
--
-- Without this, three things go wrong quietly. A staged application sits
-- in the approval queue for a role that no longer exists, so Kenechukwu spends
-- attention approving it. The submit attempt then fails in a browser
-- session with no clean way to record why. And 11-analytics counts it as
-- an application that got no reply, which is false — it never arrived,
-- and treating it as a rejection poisons the correlation data the
-- self-improvement loop learns from.

-- Apply after applications_db_schema_addendum_10.sql.
