"""
job-hunting submit-gate — a Hermes `pre_tool_call` shell hook.

Purpose (see 10-approval-and-submit/SKILL.md "Why this is a technical
boundary" and security/security-setup.md "Technical enforcement of
Rule 1"): veto a job-application submit click unless the applications DB
shows `approval_decision = 'approve'` for the exact application
10-approval-and-submit is currently working on. This is layer 3 of three
independent layers — it exists specifically because layer 2 (Hermes's
built-in dangerous-command approval) is a generic pattern-matched list,
not something written for this pipeline's submit action in particular.

How Hermes calls this: stdin gets one JSON object per invocation
(hook_event_name, tool_name, tool_input, session_id, cwd, ...). Stdout
must be a single JSON object; `{"action": "block", "message": "..."}`
vetoes the call, anything else (including `{}`) allows it. See
user-guide/features/hooks.md, "pre_tool_call" and "Shell hooks".

Design notes, read before you install this:

- This is a HEURISTIC, not a semantic understanding of the page. It
  watches a small set of tool names and does a keyword match against the
  call's own arguments (selector text / accessible name / button label —
  whatever the tool call includes). Tune WATCHED_TOOLS and
  SUBMIT_KEYWORDS against whatever ATS platforms you actually apply
  through if you see false positives (blocking a legitimate non-submit
  click that happens to say "submit" somewhere) or false negatives (an
  ATS whose submit button says something this list doesn't catch).
- It FAILS CLOSED. Any error — can't parse the hook payload, no active-
  application marker, can't read the DB, no matching row — blocks the
  call rather than letting it through on a guess. A false positive here
  costs you a re-click after checking why; a false negative costs an
  unreviewed application going out. That tradeoff is deliberate.
- It depends on 10-approval-and-submit writing
  shared/.active_application/<session_id>.json BEFORE it opens the form
  (see that skill's step 2). If you're seeing this hook block every
  submit attempt, check that marker is actually being written first —
  don't loosen this script to "just allow it" as the fix.

# the hook simply never fires. A silent absent gate is worse than a noisy
# one, so the skill fails closed on Kenechukwu's behalf rather than relying on
# this list being exhaustive.

# Case-insensitive substring match against the tool call's own arguments.
# Curated, not exhaustive — same style as Hermes's own dangerous-command
