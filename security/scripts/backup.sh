# Deliberately NOT `cp applications.db backup-$(date).db`. Four reasons,
# each one a way that loses data:
#   1. cp on a live SQLite file can capture a mid-write state.
#   2. Copying an already-corrupt DB over the last good snapshot destroys
#      the only working copy. Integrity is checked BEFORE anything moves.
#   3. A single overwritten slot is not a backup. The realistic failure
#      is a bad write found a week later, so snapshots are versioned.
#   4. Tier 1 is not just the database — the memory files, the skill tree
#      (job 5 has been editing it since install) and the sent-artifact
#      archive are equally irreplaceable.
#
# Exit non-zero on any failure so the cron delivery is a real alert.
