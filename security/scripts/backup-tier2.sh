# BK4 — weekly Tier 2 backup. See security/backup-and-recovery.md
#
# Tier 2 is regenerable, which is why this is weekly rather than nightly.
# But "regenerable" is not "free": individual_research_cache is built from
# METERED enrichment providers, so losing it means paying again for
# lookups already paid for. addendum_10's v_cost_per_outcome now measures
# exactly that, which turns this from a hunch into a number.
#
# Deliberately separate from backup.sh rather than a flag on it. Tier 1
# runs nightly and must never be skipped; Tier 2 is weekly and may be.
# One script with a mode flag invites running the cheap mode by habit.
