# Issue tracker: Local Markdown

Issues and specs for this repo live as markdown files in `.scratch/`.

## Conventions

- One feature per directory: `.scratch/<feature-slug>/`
- The spec is `.scratch/<feature-slug>/spec.md` (or `SPEC.md`, already in use in `.scratch/pipeline-completion/`)
- Implementation issues are one file per ticket at `.scratch/<feature-slug>/issues/<NN>-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`
- Triage state is recorded as a `Status:` line near the top of each issue file (see `triage-labels.md` for the role strings)
- Comments and conversation history append to the bottom of the file under a `## Comments` heading

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a new file under `.scratch/<feature-slug>/` (creating the directory if needed).

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Read the file at the referenced path. The user will normally pass the path or the issue number directly.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The **map** is a file with one **child** file per ticket.

- **Map**: `.scratch/<effort>/map.md`
- **Child ticket**: `.scratch/<effort>/issues/NN-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`
- **Blocking**: a `Blocked by: NN, NN` line near the top
- **Frontier**: scan for files that are open, unblocked, and unclaimed; first by number wins
- **Claim**: set `Status: claimed` and save before any work
- **Resolve**: append the answer under an `## Answer` heading, set `Status: resolved`
