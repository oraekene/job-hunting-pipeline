"""Dry-run the pipeline against a fixture posting (D8).

Nothing in this package could be validated before pointing it at real
employers. Every check was manual and after the fact — and the artifacts
it produces go to real companies under Rule 1's approval boundary, so
"we'll notice if it looks wrong" is a weak position to be in.

This runs against a fixture in a THROWAWAY database, asserts the
invariants that must hold, and tears down. No network access needed. It
never touches shared/applications.db.

Verifies:
  1. The migration chain applies cleanly, in order, from scratch.
  2. The superseded _3.sql stayed out of the chain.
  3. Cross-source dedup: one posting from three sources = one
     application, three posting_sources rows.
  4. Gate 2 skips are distinguishable from Gate 2 passes.
  5. Rule 1: nothing at 'submitted' without an approval decision.
  6. Soft-deleted journal entries drop out of the live set immediately.

Usage:  python 00-orchestrator/scripts/dry-run.py --skill-dir .
