"""Cron execution ledger — record what ran, and answer what didn't.

Twenty-three scheduled jobs, and before this nothing read whether any of
them ran. See shared/applications_db_schema_addendum_20.sql for why that
is a specific hazard here rather than a general nicety: jobs 1 and 9
carry wake-gates that suppress the agent turn and FAIL OPEN, so a gate
erroring in the skip direction is indistinguishable from a quiet market.

Three subcommands:

  record   one row per tick. Called by the job itself, or by its
           wake-gate when it decides to skip.
  report   what has gone silent, what keeps skipping, what is failing.
           Job 5 (weekly self-improvement review) is the intended caller.
  seed     register expected cadence from cron/cron-jobs.md, so "has not
           run" is answerable rather than guessed.

Read-only except for `record` and `seed`. Never writes to memory, never
touches an application row — this is instrumentation, and Rule 5 owns
what may write facts about Kenechukwu.

Usage:
  python cron/executions.py --db ../shared/applications.db record --job 1 \
      --name "Job discovery scan" --outcome skipped --detail "no source changed"
  python cron/executions.py --db ../shared/applications.db report
  python cron/executions.py --db ../shared/applications.db seed

  --db is a parent-parser option: it must come BEFORE the subcommand
  (record/report/seed), and the script path before that. Both
  "executions.py record ... --db ..." and "python --db ... executions.py"
  fail; the agent runs with cwd=cron/ here, hence the ../ prefix.

  On this Windows install `python3` resolves to the Microsoft Store stub
  and fails; use `python`.
